Code and raw data for the genomic analyses for our pre-print found here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.30.470656v1

This is the master branch which contains the original set of analysis, including the main analysis examining the effect of MK2 on survival in both NSCLC and other cancers. 

The "Revision 5" branch contains more extensive data, including: a) raw data (as rda or txt files) for the pan cancer analyses; b) additional pan cancer ananalyses performed during revisions of the original manuscript prior to publication; c) compressed count matrices for the various cancer types considered in our pan cancer analysis; d) count matrices and additional raw data used for the normal vs. tumor comparisons. That branch is stored in LFS format given the size of the repository, and will require lfs installation to git so that the files can be decompressed upon repo pull.
