Code and raw data for the genomic analyses for our pre-print found here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.30.470656v1

This is the master branch which contains the original set of analysis. The "Revision 5" brach contains more extensive data, including raw data (as rda or txt files) for the pan cancer analyses, and additional analyses performed during revisions of the original manuscript prior to publication. That branch is stored in LFS format given the size of the repository.
